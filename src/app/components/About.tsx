                The word hackathon is a combination of the words "HACK",
                standing for creative problem-solving, and "MARATHON".
                These are awesome events full of creativity, technology, and
                passionate tech-related students of different skill ranges
                collaborating and creating. During a certain period of time,
                attendees work in teams to develop apps, games, robotsâ€¦
                literally anything you want to build & learn about!

              HackUPC: Coding to the next level
              </BlockTitle>
              <Body>
              HackUPC is the first student hackathon in Spain. Once a year, we aim to provide
              a space for students of all experience levels from all around the world where they
              can improve and learn new skills, meet awesome people, and overall have a great 
              experience! This year's edition will be the first since the pandemic to have a
              FULLY IN-PERSON format, meaning that you can only participate by physically
              attending the event.
