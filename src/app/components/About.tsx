          <Body>
            The word hackathon is a combination of the words "<b>HACK</b>
            ", standing for creative problem-solving, and "<b>MARATHON</b>
            ". These are awesome events full of creativity, technology, and
            passionate tech-related students of different skill levels
            collaborating and creating. During a certain period of time,
            attendees work in <b>TEAMS</b> to develop apps, games, robotsâ€¦
            literally anything you want to <b>BUILD & LEARN</b> about!
