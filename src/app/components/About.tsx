            The word hackathon is a combination of the words "<b>HACK</b>
            ", standing for creative problem-solving, and "<b>MARATHON</b>
            ". These are awesome events full of creativity, technology, and
            passionate tech-related students of different skill levels
            collaborating and creating. During a certain period of time,
            attendees work in <b>TEAMS</b> to develop apps, games, robotsâ€¦
            literally anything you want to <b>BUILD & LEARN</b> about!

            HackUPC is the first student hackathon in Spain. Once a year, we aim
            to provide a space for students of all experience levels from all
            around the world where they can improve and learn new skills, meet
            awesome people, and overall have a great experience! This year's
            edition will be the first since the pandemic to have a{" "}
            <b>FULLY IN-PERSON</b> format, meaning that you can only participate
            by physically attending the event.
