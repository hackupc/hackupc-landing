            <Description>
              HackUPC is the first student hackathon in Spain. Once a year, we
              aim to provide a space for students of all experience levels from
              all around the world where they can improve and learn new skills,
              meet awesome people, and overall have a great experience! This
              year's edition will be the first since the pandemic to have a
              <b>FULLY IN-PERSON</b>
              format, meaning that you can only participate by physically
              attending the event.
