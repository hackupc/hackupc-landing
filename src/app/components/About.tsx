          <Description>
            The word hackathon is a combination of the words "HACK", standing
            for creative problem-solving, and "MARATHON". These are awesome
            events full of creativity, technology, and passionate tech-related
            students of different skill levels collaborating and creating.
            During a certain period of time, attendees work in TEAMS to develop
            apps, games, robotsâ€¦ literally anything you want to BUILD & LEARN
            about!

          <Description>
            HackUPC is the first student hackathon in Spain. Once a year, we aim
            to provide a space for students of all experience levels from all
            around the world where they can improve and learn new skills, meet
            awesome people, and overall have a great experience! This year's
            edition will be the first since the pandemic to have a FULLY
            IN-PERSON format, meaning that you can only participate by
            physically attending the event.
