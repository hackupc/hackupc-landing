              The word hackathon is a combination of the words "<b>HACK</b>",
              standing for creative problem-solving, and "<b>MARATHON</b>".
              These are awesome events full of creativity, technology, and
              passionate tech-related students of different skill levels
              collaborating and creating. During a certain period of time,
              attendees work in <b>teams</b> to develop apps, games, robotsâ€¦
              literally anything you want to <b>build & learn</b> about!
